This project is to analyze a dataset of real estate pricing in Washington DC. 
The main purpose of this project was for me to analyze the factors that affect the prices in property and houses in DC. The project has real world application since it can be used to predict the price of a property if all the information is provided. For this project I found an opensource dataset from Kaggle. This data set contains 158957 rows and 49 columns. As the analysis of data begins I remove 3 of these columns since they have a lot of null values and because they are not useful for predicting the required output. 
The goal of the project was to apply the 2 prediction models and one classificaiton model to this dataset to analyze the outputs.
